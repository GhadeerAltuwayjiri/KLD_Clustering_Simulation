# KLD Clustering Simulation

This project performs data simulations and clustering analysis using Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) to evaluate the clustering performance. It generates simulated data, applies clustering analysis, and calculates the KLD for the clusters.

## Usage

### Requirements

#### R
Ensure you have the following packages installed in R:
- `MASS`
- `flowClust`
- Any other dependent packages (e.g., `flowCore`)

#### Python
Ensure you have the following packages installed in Python:
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

### How to Run

#### R

To run the R code, open the `R/kld_clustering_simulation.R` file in your R environment and source it.

#### Python

To run the Python code, open the `Python/kld_clustering_simulation.py` file and execute it in your Python environment.

### Code Explanation

#### R Code

The R script `kld_clustering_simulation.R` generates simulated data for various covariance values (`cov_sim`), applies clustering analysis using `flowClust`, and calculates the KLD for the clusters.
